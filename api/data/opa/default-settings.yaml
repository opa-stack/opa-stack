  # Configuration for optional components..
  # They all have a helper-file in ../utils/{component_name.lower()}.py, so check
  # in them if you wonder how these values are used. They are also listed in the docs
  # @ https://opa-stack.github.io/guide/optional-components.html
  #
  # The LOAD option is always present, and can be one of auto|yes|no, all defaulting to 'auto'.
  #   * auto: Makes opa-stack look for the component using a simple dns-check. It will then try to
  #           connect as if you had written "yes", ie, it fails if it is not able to..
  #   * yes: Makes the coponent required
  #   * no: Makes it not check at all.
